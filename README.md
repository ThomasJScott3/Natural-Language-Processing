# Unit-12: Natural-Language-Processing

![My bitcoin wordcloud](https://github.com/ThomasJScott3/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/bitcoin_wordcloud.png)

For this homework, I was asked to use a variety of natural language processing tools to evaluate news articles about bitcoin and etherium using the news api. First I used sentiment analysis. Then I evaluated my findings by answering a series of questions about them. Next I used tokenizer as well as NGrams, wordclouds, spaCy and NER. I used common sense variable names throughout. Where applicable I also did my imports sequentially. Finally, be aware that you may have to change your (dot)env api variable to run my code.
